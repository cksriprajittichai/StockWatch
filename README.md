### Developer notes
- The app is currently broken, probably because a source website that the app parses has changed its structure.
- In the future, I hope to completely remove the app's backend - which currently fetches and parses source websites - and instead create/use a more generalized stock API.
- I made this project for fun during a summer break. Feel free to look around and contribute.
